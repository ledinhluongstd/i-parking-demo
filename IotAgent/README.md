An Internet of Things Agent for the Ultralight 2.0 protocol (with
[AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/), [HTTP](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/) and
[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) transports). This IoT Agent is designed to be a bridge
between Ultralight and the
[NGSI](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/specifications/master/OpenAPI/ngsiv2/ngsiv2-openapi.json)
interface of a context broker.

It is based on the
[IoT Agent Node.js Library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib).
Further general information about the FIWARE IoT Agents framework, its
architecture and the common interaction model can be found in the library's
GitHub repository.

This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). For more information
check the FIWARE Catalogue entry for the
[IoT Agents](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/tree/master/iot-agents).

## Background

This _Internet of Things Agent_ is a bridge that can be used to communicate
devices using the Ultralight 2.0 protocol and NGSI Context Brokers (like
[Orion](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion)). Ultralight 2.0 is a
lightweight text based protocol aimed to constrained devices and communications
where the bandwidth and device memory may be limited resources. This IoT Agent
will provide different transport protocol bindings for the same protocol: HTTP,
MQTT...

As is the case in any IoT Agent, this one follows the interaction model defined
in the
[Node.js IoT Agent Library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib),
that is used for the implementation of the APIs found on the IoT Agent's North
Port. Information about the architecture of the IoT Agent can be found on that
global repository. This documentation will only address those features and
characteristics that are particular to the Ultralight 2.0 IoT Agent.

Additional information about operating the component can be found in the
[Operations: logs and alarms](docs/operations.md) document.

## Install

Information about how to install the IoT Agent for Ultralight can be found at
the corresponding section of the
[Installation & Administration Guide](docs/installationguide.md).

A `Dockerfile` is also available for your use - further information can be found [here](docker/README.md)

## Usage

Information about how to use the IoT Agent can be found in the
[User & Programmers Manual](docs/usermanual.md).

The following features are listed as [deprecated](docs/deprecated.md).

## API

Apiary reference for the Configuration API can be found
[here](http://docs.telefonicaiotiotagents.apiary.io/#reference/configuration-api).
More information about IoT Agents and their APIs can be found in the IoT Agent
Library [documentation](https://iotagent-node-lib.rtfd.io/).

The latest IoT Agent for Ultralight documentation is also available on [ReadtheDocs](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Testing

[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) Test Runner + [Should.js](https://shouldjs.github.io/) Assertion Library.

The test environment is preconfigured to run BDD testing style.

Module mocking during testing can be done with [proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire)

To run tests, type

```console
npm test
```

### Are there any legal issues with AGPL 3.0? Is it safe for me to use?

There is absolutely no problem in using a product licensed under AGPL 3.0. Issues with GPL 
(or AGPL) licenses are mostly related with the fact that different people assign different 
interpretations on the meaning of the term “derivate work” used in these licenses. Due to this,
some people believe that there is a risk in just _using_ software under GPL or AGPL licenses
(even without _modifying_ it).

For the avoidance of doubt, the owners of this software licensed under an AGPL-3.0 license  
wish to make a clarifying public statement as follows:

> Please note that software derived as a result of modifying the source code of this
> software in order to fix a bug or incorporate enhancements is considered a derivative 
> work of the product. Software that merely uses or aggregates (i.e. links to) an otherwise 
> unmodified version of existing software is not considered a derivative work, and therefore
> it does not need to be released as under the same license, or even released as open source.
