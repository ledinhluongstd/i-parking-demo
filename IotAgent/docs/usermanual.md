## API Overview
This section describes the specific South-bound API implemented by this IoTAgent. For the Configuration API and other
APIs concerning general IoTAgents, check the [API Reference section](#apireference);

### Ultralight 2.0 Protocol
#### Description
Ultralight 2.0 is a lightweight text based protocol aimed to constrained devices and communications where the
bandwidth and device memory may be limited resources.

#### Measure Payload Syntax
The payload for information update requests is composed of a list of key-value pairs separated by the `|` character. E.g.:

```text
t|15|k|abc
```

In this example, two attributes, one named "t" with value "15" and another named "k" with value "abc" are transmitted.
Values in Ultralight 2.0 are not typed (everything is treated as a string).

Multiple groups of measures can be combined into a single request, using the `#` character. In that case, a different
NGSI request will be generated for each group of measures. E.g.:

```text
gps|1.2/3.4#t|10
```
This will generate two NGSI requests for the same entity, one for each one of the values. Each one of those requests
can contain any number of attributes.

Measure groups can additionaly have an optional timestamp, with the following syntax:

```text
2016-06-13T00:35:30Z|lle|100
```
The timestamp will be added as a prefix of the measures themselves, separated by a '|'. The attribute will be translated
to a `TimeInstant` attribute in the final entity.T

#### Active versus passive attributes
Current version of the agent only supports active attributes, i.e. those attributes actively reported
+by the device to the agent. Passive or lazy attributes, i.e. those attributes whose value is only given upon explicit
+request from the agent, are not implemented. Please check the issue
+[#23](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-ul/issues/23) for more details and updates regarding its implementation.

#### Commands Syntax
Commands are messages sent to the device from the IoT Agent. A command has the following format:

```text
<device name>@<command name>|<command value>
```
This indicates that the device (named 'device_name' in the Context Broker) has to execute the command 'command_name', with
the given value. E.g.:

```text
Robot1@turn|left
```
This example will tell the Robot 1 to turn to left.

In the case of complex commands requiring parameters, the `command_value` could be used to implement parameter passing. E.g:
```text
weatherStation167@ping|param1=1|param2=2
```
This example will tell the Weather Station 167 to reply to a ping message with the provided params.

Once the command has finished its execution in the device, the reply to the server must adhere to the following format:
```text
<device name>@<command name>|result
```
Where `device_name` and `command_name` must be the same ones used in the command execution, and the result is the
final result of the command. E.g.:
```text
weatherStation167@ping|Ping ok
```
In this case, the Weather station replies with a String value indicating everything has worked fine.

#### Bidirectionality Syntax
The latest versions of the Provisioning API allow for the definition of reverse expressions to keep data shared between
the Context Broker and the device in sync (regardless of whether the data originated in plain data from the device or
in a transformation expression in the IoTAgent). In this cases, when a reverse expression is defined, whenever the
bidirectional attribute is modified, the IoTAgent sends a command to the original device, with the name defined in the
reverse expression attribute and the ID of the device (see Commands Syntax, just above).


#### Casting to JSON native format
Ultralight 2.0 defines a method that allows to use native JSON types in the NGSIv2. For example:
The IotAgent receives this UL measure:
```text
t|10|s|true|l|78.8
```
then the NGSIv2 update uses ```10```(number), ```true``` (boolean) and ```78.8``` (number) instead of "10" (string), "true" (string) and "78.8" (string).

This functionality relies on string measures casting feature implemented in the iotagent library. In order to use it, the `autocast` configuration parameter has to be set to true. Please see [configuration section of iotagent library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib/blob/master/doc/installationguide.md#global-configuration) for further information.

In addition, the device has to be provisioned using the right types for the attributes to be cast, which are:

* Type "Number" for integer or float numbers
* Type "Boolean" for boolean
* Type "None" for null

As a consequence of the above, note the casting to JSON native format doesn't work for autoprovisioned devices as
autoprovisioning doesn't allow to provide explicit types for each attribute (all them are considered of default
type "string").

### Transport Protocol
Ultralight 2.0 defines a payload describing measures and commands to share between devices and servers but, does not
specify a single transport protocol. Instead, different transport protocol bindings can be established for different
scenarios.

The following sections describe the bindings currently supported: HTTP, MQTT and AMQP.

#### HTTP binding
There are three possible interactions defined in the HTTP binding: requests with GET, requests with POST and commands.

##### Requests with GET requests
A device can report new measures to the IoT Platform using an HTTP GET request to the `/iot/d` path with the following
query parameters:

* **i (device ID)**: Device ID (unique for the API Key).
* **k (API Key)**: API Key for the service the device is registered on.
* **t (timestamp)**: Timestamp of the measure. Will override the automatic IoTAgent timestamp (optional).
* **d (Data)**: Ultralight 2.0 payload.

Payloads for GET requests should not contain multiple measure groups.

##### Requests with POST requests
Another way of reporting measures is to do it using a POST request. In this case, the payload is passed along as the
request payload. Two query parameters are still mandatory:

* **i (device ID)**: Device ID (unique for the API Key).
* **k (API Key)**: API Key for the service the device is registered on.
* **t (timestamp)**: Timestamp of the measure. Will override the automatic IoTAgent timestamp (optional).

##### Sending commands
MQTT devices commands are always push. For HTTP Devices commands to be push they **must** be provisioned with the `endpoint` attribute, that will contain the URL where the IoT Agent will send the received commands. Otherwise the command will be poll.
When using the HTTP transport, the command handling have two flavours:

* **Push commands**: The request payload format will be the one described in the
UL Protocol description. The device will reply with a 200OK response containing the result of the command in the UL2.0
result format.

* **Polling commands**: in this case, the Agent does not send any messages to the device, being the later responsible
of retrieving them from the IoTAgent whenever the device is ready to get commands. In order to retrieve commands from
the IoT Agent, the device will send the query parameter 'getCmd' with value '1' as part of a normal measure. As a result
of this action, the IoTAgent, instead of returning an empty body (the typical response to a measurement report), will return
a list of all the commands available for the device, sepparated by the character '#'. The command payload is described
in the protocol section (and its shared with the push commands). Whenever the device has completed the execution of the
command, it will send the response in the same way measurements are reported, but using the **command result format** as
exposed in the [Protocol section](#protocol).

Some additional remarks regarding polling commands:

* Commands can be also retrieved without needed of sending a mesaure. In other words, the device is not forced to send a
measure in order to get the accumulated commands.

#### MQTT binding
MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/IoT connectivity protocol, focused on a lightweight interaction between peers. MQTT
is based on publish-subscribe mechanisms over a hierarchical set of topics defined by the user.

This section specifies the topics and messages allowed when using MQTT as the transport protocol for Ultralight 2.0. All
the topics used with the MQTT protocol contain the same prefix:
```text
<apiKey>/<deviceId>
```
where `<apiKey>` is the API Key assigned to the service and `<deviceId>` is the ID of the device.

This transport protocol binding is still under development.

##### Sending a single measure in one message
In order to send a single measure value to the server, the device must publish the plain value to the following topic:
```text
<apiKey>/<deviceId>/attrs/<attrName>
```
Where `<apiKey>` and `<deviceId>` have the typical meaning and `<attrName>` is the name of the measure the device is
sending.

or instance, if using [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) with a device with ID `id_sen1`, API Key `ABCDEF` and attribute
IDs `h` and `t`, then humidity measures are reported this way:

```bash
    $ mosquitto_pub -t /ABCDEF/id_sen1/attrs/h -m 70 -h <mosquitto_broker> -p <mosquitto_port> -u <user> -P <password>
```

##### Sending multiple measures in one message
In order to send multiple measures in a single message, a device must publish a message in the following topic:
```text
<apiKey>/<deviceId>/attrs
```
Where `<apiKey>` and `<deviceId>` have the typical meaning. The payload of such message should be a legal Ultralight 2.0
payload (with or without measure groups).

For instance, if using [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) with a device with ID `id_sen1`, API Key `ABCDEF` and attribute
IDs `h` and `t`, then all measures (humidity and temperature) are reported this way:

```bash
    $ mosquitto_pub -t /ABCDEF/id_sen1/attrs -m 'h|70|t|15' -h <mosquitto_broker> -p <mosquitto_port> -u <user> -P <password>
```
##### Commands
Commands using the MQTT transport protocol binding always work in PUSH mode: the server publishes a message in a topic
where the device is subscribed: the *commands topic*. Once the device has finished with the command, it publishes it result
to another topic.

The *commands topic*, where the client will be subscribed has the following format:
```text
<apiKey>/<deviceId>/cmd
```

The result of the command must be reported in the following topic:
```text
<apiKey>/<deviceId>/cmdexe
```
The command execution and command reporting payload format is specified under the Ultralight 2.0 Commands Syntax, above.

For instance, if a user wants to send a command `ping` with parameters `data = 22`, he will send the following request
to the Context Broker regarding an entity called `sen1` of type `sensor`:

```json
{
  "updateAction": "UPDATE",
  "contextElements": [
    {
      "id": "sen1",
      "type": "sensor",
      "isPattern": "false",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "ping",
          "type": "command",
          "value": "22"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If the API key associated to de device is `ABCDEF`, and the device ID related to `sen1` entity is `id_sen1`, this
will generate a message in the `/ABCDEF/id_sen1/cmd` topic with the following payload:

```text
id_sen1@ping|22
```

If using [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), such a command is received by running the `mosquitto_sub` script:

```bash
$ mosquitto_sub -v -t /# -h <mosquitto_broker> -p <mosquitto_port> -u <user> -P <password> /ABCDEF/id_sen1/cmd id_sen1@ping|22
```

At this point, Context Broker will have updated the value of `ping_status` to `PENDING` for `sen1` entity. Neither
`ping_info` nor `ping` are updated.

Once the device has executed the command, it can publish its results in the `/ABCDEF/id_sen1/cmdexe` topic with a
payload with the following format:

```text
id_sen1@ping|1234567890
```

If using [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), such command result is sent by running the `mosquitto_pub` script:

```bash
$ mosquitto_pub -t /ABCDEF/id_sen1/cmdexe -m 'id_sen1@ping|1234567890' -h <mosquitto_broker> -p <mosquitto_port> -u <user> -P <password>
```

In the end, Context Broker will have updated the values of `ping_info` and `ping_status` to `1234567890` and `OK`,
respectively. `ping` attribute is never updated.

#### AMQP binding
[AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/) stands for Advance Message Queuing Protocol, and is one of the most popular protocols for message-queue systems.
Although the protocol itself is software independent and allows for a great architectural flexibility, this transport
binding has been designed to work with the [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) broker, in a way that closely
resembles the MQTT binding (in the previous section). In fact, for IoT Platform deployments in need of an scalable MQTT
Broker, RabbitMQ with the MQTT plugin will be used, connecting the IoT Agent to RabbitMQ through AMQP and the clients
to RabbitMQ through MQTT.

The binding connects the IoT Agent to an exchange (usually `amq.topic`) and creates two queues (to share between all
the instances of the IoTAgents in a cluster environment): one for the incoming measures, and another for command
result update messages (named as the measure one, adding the `_commands` sufix).

For both measure reporting and command update status the mechanism is much the same as in the case of the MQTT binding: all
the messages must be published to the selected exchange, using the following routing keys:

| Key pattern                           | Meaning                    |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| .<apiKey>.<deviceId>.attrs            | Multiple measure reporting |
| .<apiKey>.<deviceId>.attrs.<attrName> | Single measure reporting   |
| .<apiKey>.<deviceId>.cmd              | Command reception          |
| .<apiKey>.<deviceId>.cmdexe           | Command update message     |

The payload is the same as for the other bindings.

## Developing new transports
The Ultralight 2.0 IoT Agent can work with multiple different transports for the same Ultralight 2.0 payload. Those
transports are dinamically loaded when the Agent starts, by looking in the `lib/bindings` folder for Node.js Modules.
Those module must export the following fields:

* **deviceProvisioningHandler(device, callback)**: this handler will be called each time a new device is provisioned
in the IoT Agent. The device object contains all the information provided in the device registration.

* **configurationHandler(configuration, callback)**: handler for changes (provisioning or updates) in device groups. This
handler should be used when configuration groups require any initialization or registration in the protocol binding.

* **start(newConfig, callback)**: starts the binding module, with the provided configuration. The `newConfig` object
contains the global Agent configuration; the module should use a specific attribute inside the global scope to hold all
its configuration values instead of using the global configuration scope itself.

* **stop(callback)**: stops the binding module.

* **protocol**: This field must contain a string key identifying the protocol. Requests coming from the server (commands
and passive attributes) will use the `protocol` field of the devices and the corresponding `protocol` attribute in the
modules to identify which module should attend the request.

All the methods **must** call the callback before exiting (with or without error). Bindings will use methods in the
IoT Agent Node.js library to interact process incoming requests.
